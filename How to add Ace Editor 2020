//Ace Editor is the editor Synapse X uses. It detects if a script has any errors.
This uses WinForm.
//1. Okay, first right click "Form1" then click "Select Form1".
//2. Now, if you see properties click on the lightning bolt. Now you are in remote event, find "Load" then double click on it.
//3. Now, you should see "Form1_Load" blah blah blah something related to that.
//Okay, before you do this, make sure you have downloaded the Ace Editor file. Here is the link: https://bit.ly/2TWptg2
//Now, find the top right corner and click "Download as ZIP". Then, save it in your "Download" section. Right click the folder and click "Extract Files" then click "Ok".
//Your files should pop up, ok now go to the windows search bar and search up "repos". Select your exploit folder and then bin > Debug then drag the extracted ace folder inside.
//4. Open Toolbox and drag webBrowser onto your WinForm. Size it to your preferences.
//5. Insert this code under Form1_Load between the {

                                                   } like this.
Code = this.webBrowser1.Navigate(string.Format("file:///{0}ace/AceEditor.html", AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory));
Should look something like this:
Form1_Load
{
this.webBrowser1.Navigate(string.Format("file:///{0}ace/AceEditor.html", AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory));
}
Okay, now run your solution and you should have it. Here are some basic codes for stuff.
Execute: (Requires you making EasyExploits a module)
HtmlDocument document = webBrowser1.Document;
            string scriptName = "GetText";
            object[] args = new string[0];
            object obj = document.InvokeScript(scriptName, args);
            string script = obj.ToString();
            module.ExecuteScript(script);
Clear:
webBrowser1.Document.InvokeScript("SetText", new object[]
                    {
                        ""
                    });
Any script button:
webBrowser1.Document.InvokeScript("SetText", new object[]
                    {
                        "Insert script here"
                    });
